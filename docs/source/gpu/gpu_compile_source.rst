Compile |project| from Source with CUDA
=======================================

The second method to make |project| to be compatible with am existing CUDA installation is to compile :mod:`imate` from source. :mod:`imate` is a dependency package used by |project| that performs linear algebraic computations on GPU devices. Note that |project| itself does not have to be compiled from source. See :ref:`compile imate from the source <gpu-compile-imate>` for details.
